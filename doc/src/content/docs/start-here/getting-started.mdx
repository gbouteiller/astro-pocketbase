description: How to automatically setup the Astro PocketBase integration.
---
import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This integration is built on top of [Zod PocketBase](https://zod-pocketbase.vercel.app) to ease the use of **PocketBase** in your **Astro** projects by:
- generating **schemas** for your selected collections
- generating a **loader** that you can use for your content collections
- generating a **middleware** that gives you access to the [PocketBase SDK](https://github.com/pocketbase/js-sdk) in `Astro.locals`

## Installation

Astro includes an `astro add` command to automate the setup of official integrations. If you prefer, you can [install integrations manually](/start-here/manual-setup) instead.

To install `astro-pocketbase`, run the following from your project directory and follow the prompts:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```shell
    npx astro add astro-pocketbase
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
    ```shell
    pnpm astro add astro-pocketbase
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
    ```shell
    yarn astro add astro-pocketbase
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

If you run into any issues, [feel free to report them to us on GitHub](https://github.com/gbouteiller/astro-pocketbase/issues) and try the manual setup instead.

## Environment variables

You also need to provide 3 environment variables for **Astro PocketBase** to retrieve your collections:

```shell
# This will only be available when run on the server!
ASTRO_POCKETBASE_ADMIN_EMAIL="admin@mydomain.com"
ASTRO_POCKETBASE_ADMIN_PASSWORD="mypassword"
# This will be available everywhere!
PUBLIC_ASTRO_POCKETBASE_URL="https://myproject.pockethost.io"
```
